# ðŸš€ YeetCode  

**YeetCode** is a CLI tool designed for developers to easily pull LeetCode problems into their local environment, generate AI-powered test cases, and run solutionsâ€”all without leaving their setup.  

## âš¡ Features  
- Fetch LeetCode problems directly into your workspace  
- Dynamically generate test cases using AI  
- Run and validate your solutions locally  
- Optimized for AWS, keeping costs minimal  
- No passive costsâ€”compute only when needed  

## ðŸ›  Installation & Usage  

You'll need Python 3.8+ and AWS CLI configured. Install YeetCode with:  

```bash
# Install YeetCode
pip install yeetcode

# Listing all problems
yeetcode list

# Pulling Problems
yeetcode pull <problem_id>

# Testing Solutions
yeetcode test # From inside the problem directory
```

## ðŸ’¡ What YeetCode Does  

1. Fetches problem data from LeetCode.  
2. Generates test cases on demand.  
3. Runs tests locally using Pythonâ€™s unittest or pytest framework.  
4. Caches results to minimize redundant API calls.

**Note:** The backend components like AWS Lambda, Bedrock/SageMaker, DynamoDB/S3 are abstracted away. You donâ€™t need to worry about themâ€”just focus on solving problems!
