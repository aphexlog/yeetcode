# ðŸš€ YeetCode  

A CLI tool that lets developers seamlessly pull LeetCode problems into their local environment, generate AI-powered test cases, and run solutionsâ€”all without leaving their setup.  

## âš¡ Features  
- **Fetch LeetCode problems** directly into your workspace  
- **Dynamically generate test cases** using AI  
- **Run and validate your solutions locally**  
- **Optimized for AWS**, keeping costs minimal  
- **No passive costs**â€”compute only when needed  

## ðŸ›  Installation & Usage  

You'll need Python 3.8+ and AWS CLI configured. Install YeetCode with:  

```bash
# Install YeetCode
pip install yeetcode

# Listing all problems
yeetcode list

# Pulling Problems
yeetcode pull <problem_id>

# Testing Solutions
yeetcode test # From inside the problem directory
```

1.	Fetches problem data from LeetCode.
2.	Uses AWS Lambda & Bedrock/SageMaker to generate test cases on demand.
3.	Runs tests locally using Pythonâ€™s unittest or pytest framework.
4.	Caches results in DynamoDB/S3 to minimize redundant API calls.
